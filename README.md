*In my time as a software developer I have yet to find my dream language. This is a hard task, and I have not succeeded. In my opinion C is very close, but not quite there. A programming language should be easy to learn and enforce good coding practice. Most importantly it should be easy to read. This is the main intention with this language. I do not expect that anyone other than me will use it; thus the name *unknown*.*
